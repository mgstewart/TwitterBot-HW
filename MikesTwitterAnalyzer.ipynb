    "# Sentiment Analyzing Twitter Bot\n",
    "## An exercise in making Twitter a more objective space.\n",
    "* Positives: \n",
    "  * The decision to implement a csv that tracks previously analyzed will ultimately save the dyno on memory usage as opposed to storing all analyzed twitter handles in memory.\n",
    "  * The bot will identify a previously analyzed handle and tweet out the saved analysis image file. This approach is more costly on storage space, but that is generally cheaper than memory. \n",
    "  * The bot is responsive and uses try/except blocks to avoid crashes.\n",
    "  * The bot is deployed on Heroku and should continue into perpetuity or until disk space/memory space exceeds a free dyno's limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Negatives: The current code has ~~several~~ no known bugs.  \n",
    "  * ~~The first is that it self-extracts its own Twitter handle and for some reason does not register that despite If/Else logic for it. There are several provisions for this in the code and all seem to miss it. I believe this is related to Twitter's API handling incomplete handles and attempting to 'guess' which handle you meant. In a previous version, the tweets of the letter p were even analyzed (and there was 500 and it was not decidedly negative or positive.~~\n",
    "  * ~~For whatever reason, despite posting identical statuses, Twitter does not block them. The code has a provision for a tweepy error for duplicate statuses that should lead it into a cycle of sleeping until a user tweets at it.~~\n",
